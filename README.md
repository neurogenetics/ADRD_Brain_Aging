# ADRD_Brain_Aging
ADRD Brain Aging projects
- Phase 1: single-nuclei atlas between young and old subjects in four brain regions
    - Where 'young' subjects were between 20-30 years of age at time of death and 'old' were 60-80 years of age at time of death
    - brain regions included for each subject are: putamen, entorhinal cortex, middle temporal gyrus, and subventricular zone
- Phase 2: future work
    - expansion in the number of subjects included and analyses using age as a continuous variable
    - focus on a single brain region for the expanded subject series
