# ADRD_Brain_Aging Phase 1 
- single-nuclei atlas between young and old subjects in four brain regions
- Where 'young' subjects were between 20-30 years of age at time of death and 'old' were 60-80 years of age at time of death
- brain regions included for each subject are: putamen, entorhinal cortex, middle temporal gyrus, and subventricular zone

## Analyses
### Demultiplexing
    - use subject genotypes to deconvolute cells from pools and assign each cell to a subject using Demuxlet to eastablish identity based on genotype
